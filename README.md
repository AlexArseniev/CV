# CV
Nowadays it is very important for the companies to hire the right person for the right position. That is why a centralized system where you can have the available positions and the approved CVs is a must. The system will be developed as MVC using Tkinter as front-end, SQL-light. 
The main user roles (actors in CVR) are:

•	Employee – can only view the available positions in the firm and recommend a friend.

•	Manager - can see the available positions in the firm and the aproved CV's, request an employee.

•	HR  – aproves CV's and enters them into the system. The "HR" position can book an interview with a manager and employee and has the right to add an open position to the system.

•	Administrator  – can manage (create, edit roles and delete) all CV's and available positions.
